# Orchestrator Activity Log
## Entry 1: Enforce LLM Model Constraints and Add 'Thinking' Functionality

### User Request:
Enforce specific LLM models across several agent scripts:
- ResearchAgent: Various vision models:  - Vision Models to be called through the OpenRouter API using OpenRouter API Key
OPENROUTER_LLAMA_MAVERICK = "meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free"
OPENROUTER_LLAMA_SCOUT = "meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free"
OPENROUTER_QWEN_VL = "qwen/qwen2.5-vl-72b-instruct:free"
OPENROUTER_INTERNVL = "opengvlab/internvl3-14b:free"
OPENROUTER_MISTRAL3 = "mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free"
OPENROUTER_GEMMA3 = "google/gemma-3-27b-it:free"
 - Vision Models to be called through the Google Gemini API using Gemini API Key, or Google Vertex AI API using Vertex AI project credentials
GEMINI_IMAGE_SEARCH_MODEL = "gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25"
FLASH_IMAGE_SEARCH_MODEL = "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
 - Vision Models to be called through the Grok OpenAI-compatible API using Grok API Key
GROK_IMAGE_SEARCH_MODEL = "grok-2-vision-1212"
 - Consolidation Model to be called through the Grok OpenAI-compatible API using Grok API Key
CONSOLIDATION_MODEL = "grok-3-mini-fast-high-beta"

- Consolidation/Communication Model: `grok-3-mini-fast-high-beta`
, `grok-3-mini-fast-high-beta` for consolidation/communication
- VisionAgents: `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` for vision, `grok-3-mini-fast-high-beta` for communication
- PlacardAgent: `grok-3-mini-fast-high-beta` for communication
- DocentAgent: `grok-3-mini-fast-high-beta` for all communication/reasoning

Add 'thinking' functionality using `grok-3-mini-fast-high-beta`.

### Orchestrator Plan:
1. Delegate logging to Architect.
2. Delegate documentation update (reflecting LLM constraints) to Architect.
3. Delegate code verification (LLM constraints) and 'thinking' implementation to Coder.
4. Monitor and synthesize results.

## 2025-05-06 09:26 AM - Escalation from Code Mode Failure
- Task: Diagnose and fix lack of expected exceptions for corrupted or unsupported images in vision agents.
- Issue: Repeated failures in unit tests for test_missing_file_handling; FileNotFoundError is being re-raised as UnsupportedImageFormatError in vision_agent_animal.py's analyze_image method.
- Attempts: At least 5 failed test runs and code modifications by Roo Coder.
- Error Details: Traceback shows FileNotFoundError caught and re-raised as UnsupportedImageFormatError.
- Environment: Current workspace /Users/nathaniel.cannon/Documents/VScodeWork/Art_AI; recently modified files include art_agent_team/agents/vision_agent_animal.py and art_agent_team/tests/test_vision_agent.py.
- Next Steps: After logging, signal completion and transfer control back to Orchestrator mode.
- This subtask should only perform the logging operation as specified.
