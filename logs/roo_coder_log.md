# Roo Coder Log - ResearchAgent Refactor

**Task:** Implement the refactored ResearchAgent based on architectural design and research findings.

**Date:** 2025-05-05

**Steps:**

1.  **Review Request & Context:** Analyzed task requirements, focusing on unified workflow, model integration, JSON output, and error handling. Target file: `art_agent_team/agents/research_agent.py`.
2.  **Read Existing Code:** Used `read_file` to load `art_agent_team/agents/research_agent.py`. Found significant refactoring already present.
3.  **Read Design Document:** Used `read_file` to load `art_agent_team/docs/ResearchAgent_Refactor_Detailed_Plan.md`.
4.  **Compare Code vs. Plan:** Analyzed existing code against the detailed plan and initial requirements. Identified that most features were implemented, but the `limitations` field was missing from the output JSON schema.
5.  **Implement `limitations` Field:** Used `apply_diff` to modify `art_agent_team/agents/research_agent.py`:
    *   Added `limitations` description to `PromptTemplate.master_template`.
    *   Added `limitations` instructions and example to `PromptTemplate.get_consolidation_prompt`.
    *   Added default `limitations` field to `_create_error_json`.
    *   Added default `limitations` field to `_ensure_standard_fields`.
6.  **Address Indentation Errors (Attempt 1):** The first `apply_diff` introduced Pylance indentation errors.
7.  **Read File Section:** Used `read_file` to examine the code sections (lines 790-850) with errors.
8.  **Fix Indentation Errors (Attempt 2):** Used `apply_diff` to correct indentation in `_create_error_json` and `_ensure_standard_fields`. This attempt was partially successful.
9.  **Read File Section Again:** Used `read_file` to re-examine the code section (lines 815-850) after the partial fix.
10. **Fix Indentation Errors (Attempt 3):** Used `apply_diff` again to correct the remaining indentation issues in `_ensure_standard_fields`. This attempt was successful.
11. **Update Log:** Updated this log file.

**Status:** Implementation of the `limitations` field and correction of resulting indentation errors are complete. The `ResearchAgent` now aligns with the specified requirements.

**Task:** Modify `art_agent_team/main.py` to output logs to both the terminal and `terminal_output.log`.

**Action:**
- Read `art_agent_team/main.py` to understand current logging setup.
- Used `apply_diff` to modify `art_agent_team/main.py`.
- Added a `logging.FileHandler` for `terminal_output.log` to the root logger.
- Ensured the new handler uses the same formatter as the console handler for consistency.
- Explicitly set `basicConfig` stream to `sys.stdout` for clarity.

**Result:** The script now logs to both destinations as required.

**Task:** Modify logging filter to apply to console output as well.

**Action:**
- Modified `art_agent_team/main.py` using `apply_diff`.
- Added logic to iterate through root logger handlers and add the `TruncateImageDataFilter` instance to any `StreamHandler` associated with `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`.

**Result:** The image data truncation filter now applies to both the log file and the console output.
## 2025-05-05 21:13 - Roo Coder

**Task:** Fix log filtering for large 'data:' lines.
**Action:** Updated the `TruncateImageDataFilter` in `art_agent_team/main.py`.
**Details:** Replaced the previous filter logic with a new regex (`DATA_PATTERN_REGEX`) and `re.subn` approach to find and truncate `'data': '...'` or `"data": "..."` patterns anywhere within the log message, addressing issues where the data field was nested.
**File Modified:** `art_agent_team/main.py`
## 2025-05-05 21:19

**Task:** Remove logging statements outputting raw model responses/API requests from open files.

**Actions:**
*   Searched open Python files for potential logging statements using regex: `(logging\.(info|debug|warning|error|critical)|print)\s*\(.*?\b(response|request|api_response|api_request)\b`
*   Modified `art_agent_team/agents/research_agent.py`:
    *   Removed raw `completion` object logging from line 760.
    *   Removed `candidate.content` logging from lines 833 and 891.
*   Checked `art_agent_team/docent_agent.py`: No changes needed.
*   Checked `art_agent_team/main.py`: No changes needed.
*   Checked `art_agent_team/agents/vision_agent_animal.py`: No changes needed.
*   Modified `art_agent_team/agents/vision_agent_abstract.py`:
    *   Commented out raw `response_text` logging on lines 619 and 635.
*   Modified `art_agent_team/agents/vision_agent_figurative.py`:
    *   Commented out raw `response_text` logging on lines 610 and 626.
*   Modified `art_agent_team/agents/vision_agent_genre.py`:
    *   Commented out raw `response_text` logging on lines 620 and 640.
*   Modified `art_agent_team/agents/vision_agent_landscape.py`:
    *   Commented out raw `response_text` logging on lines 705 and 721.
*   Modified `art_agent_team/agents/vision_agent_portrait.py`:
    *   Commented out raw `response_text` logging on lines 666 and 682.

**Result:** Successfully removed or commented out identified logging statements that exposed raw response data in the specified open files.
## [2025-05-05 22:43] ResearchAgent/DocentAgent Error Resolution and Test Iteration

- Updated ModelRegistry in research_agent.py to clarify log messages when skipping model registration due to missing API keys/configs.
- Verified DocentAgent (docent_agent.py) already displays a numbered workflow list and removed conversational placeholders.
- Added TestModelRegistryLogging to tests/test_research_agent.py to assert that unavailable models are skipped and correct warnings are logged, with no crash.
- Fixed test file structure to ensure all test classes are above the main block.
- All changes validated for robust error handling and integration.
