        Upscale the input image using the Stability AI API (conservative upscale to near 4K).
        Saves the upscaled image to output_path.
        The "esrgan-v1-x2plus" model only supports 2x upscale.
        To reach ~4K, we might need to upscale, then resize, or check if Stability offers other models/options.
        For now, this implements a 2x upscale. If the original is small, it won't reach 4K.
        The API also has width/height parameters that can be used for upscaling to specific dimensions if the model supports it.
        The fast upscaler "esrgan-v1-x2plus" might not support arbitrary width/height for output, typically just a scale factor.
        Let's stick to the 2x upscale provided by "esrgan-v1-x2plus" and then resize if necessary,
        or instruct the user about the limitation.

        The API documentation for "esrgan-v1-x2plus" suggests it's a 2x upscaler.
        It also mentions a `width` or `height` parameter for the output image, max 2048 for `esrgan-v1-x2plus`.
        This implies we can upscale to a max dimension of 2048.
        To achieve "4K" (e.g., 3840 width), this model alone isn't sufficient if the input is e.g. 1024px wide (2x -> 2048px).

        Let's try to use the `width` parameter to get as close to 4K as possible, up to the model's limit.
        The API seems to prefer one dimension (width or height) for scaling.
        We will aim for the target_width, respecting the 2048px max for this specific engine.
        If a larger upscale is needed, a different Stability model or multiple passes (if supported) would be required.
        For this task, we'll use the "esrgan-v1-x2plus" and its 2x capability / max 2048px dimension.
        We will upscale by 2x and then, if the user strictly needs 3840x2160, a separate resize step would be needed
        which is not ideal for quality.

        Revisiting Stability AI API docs:
        For upscale, you provide an image and can specify `width` or `height` for the output.
        The `esrgan-v1-x2plus` engine is primarily a 2x upscaler.
        If `width` or `height` is provided, it will upscale to that dimension, but the maximum for this engine is 2048.
        So, we can upscale to a width of 2048. If 4K (3840) is strictly needed, this model is insufficient.
        The prompt mentioned "upscaling to 4k".

        Let's assume "fast upscaler" implies `esrgan-v1-x2plus`.
        We will upscale to the largest possible dimension (max 2048) while maintaining aspect ratio.
        Then, the placard can be generated on this image. If a true 4K is needed, this is a limitation.
        Let's aim for a width of 2048 as the maximum output from this specific upscaler.
        The user asked for "upscaling to 4k" and "UpscaleAgent to use Stability AI fast upscaler".
        These might be conflicting if the fast upscaler cannot reach 4K.
        We will use the fast upscaler and get the best possible result from it.
        Let's target 2x upscale and save. The "4K" might be an ideal, not a strict requirement for this step.
        The API endpoint is `https://api.stability.ai/v1/generation/{engine_id}/image-to-image/upscale`
        It accepts `image`, and optionally `width` or `height`.
        If neither width nor height is specified, it performs a 2x upscale. Max output pixels: 4.2M. Max input pixels: 1M.
        Max output dimension for esrgan-v1-x2plus is 2048x2048.

        Let's perform a 2x upscale. If the resulting image is still smaller than the desired 4K dimensions,
        it's a limitation of the chosen "fast upscaler".
